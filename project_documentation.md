## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Structure
- **Component-based architecture**: Components organized by feature and common elements
- **Context API**: For state management via AppContext
- **Services layer**: For API communication
- **Hooks**: For shared functionality
- **Responsive design**: Using TailwindCSS for mobile-friendly views

### Backend Structure
- **RESTful API**: Following standard REST patterns
- **MVC-like architecture**: Controllers, routes, and services separation
- **Modular services**: Separate services for profile data, company data, and content generation
- **Error handling**: Consistent error response format

### API Endpoints
- `/api/profile/analyze`: Analyzes LinkedIn profiles
- `/api/company/analyze`: Analyzes LinkedIn company pages
- `/api/message/analyze`: Analyzes client messages
- `/api/health`: Health check endpoint

### Data Flow
1. User enters data (profile URL, company URL, or message) in the frontend
2. Frontend sends data to the backend via API
3. Backend processes the data through appropriate services
4. AI-generated content is returned to the frontend
5. Frontend displays the results with visualization
